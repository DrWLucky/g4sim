#Simulation for Ge Callibration
##Geometry
![Overview](pic_geometry.png "Overview")
Here three versions of geometries have been used:

1.	The same geomtry as last time,
where the distance from the front end of Ge detector to the target is set to 30 cm,
and the flange before Ge detector is 5 mm thick Aluminum.  
2.	distance = 35 cm, thickness = 5 mm.  
3.	distance = 30 cm, thickness = 10 mm.  

##Procedure
1.	Generate 10<sup>6</sup> **Eu152** to find peaks and check the ratio of each peak  

			cd $MYG4SIMWORKROOT
			g4sim macros/CheckEu152.mac
			cd scripts/GeCallibration
			root -l get_peaks.C

	You will get:  

			Total events: 1000000
			Events with RadioactiveDecay Gamma Ray: 991841
			Peaks with ratio over 5%: (error +-0.025keV)
				Index	Energy		Ratio
				     	keV   		Ngam/Nevents
				0	121.775		0.282415
				1	244.675		0.076972
				2	344.275		0.265659
				3	778.925		0.129626
				4	964.075		0.14587
				5	1085.875		0.101973
				6	1112.075		0.136631
				7	1407.975		0.210716
			Gammas from all peaks: 1594107
			Gammas from highest 8 peaks: 1349862

	Where the last number of each peak line is the ratio of that peak,
	which is defined as Ratio = N<sub>peak</sub>/N<sub>Eu152</sub>.

2.	Generate 7x10<sup>6</sup> **Eu152** from source position and record Ge response.
	Check the efficiency of each peak with given ratios (got from #1, written into `get_eff.C`)

	**Option 1:** distance = 30 cm; thickness = 5 mm  

			cd $MYG4SIMWORKROOT
			bg4sim_sub -t sim -b 0 -e 6 -Y GeCallibration GeCallibration001
			cd scripts/Callibration
			root -l get_eff.C

##Result:	
**Eu152** decay in Geant4 is based on `G4RadioactiveDeacy`. Peaks can be seen below:  
![MCPeaks](pic_mcpeaks.png "Gammas from Eu152")  
Ge response (energy deposition inside Ge) in **option 1**:  
![GePeaks](pic_gepeaks.png "Ge Detector Response")  
If we fit log(Eff) VS log(E), for **option 1**:  
![FitEff1](pic_fiteff_1.png "Efficiency VS Energy")  
Here the slope is `-0.877724   +/-   0.0410669`, constant is `-2.02044   +/-   0.271757`  
for **option 2**:  
![FitEff2](pic_fiteff_2.png "Efficiency VS Energy")  
Here the slope is `-0.878572   +/-   0.0273766`, constant is `-2.34931   +/-   0.181163`  
for **option 3**:  
![FitEff3](pic_fiteff_3.png "Efficiency VS Energy")  
Here the slope is `-0.822675   +/-   0.0740088`, constant is `-2.51174   +/-   0.489747`  

##Comparison with [CW_140615](CW_140615.md)  
1.	**Option 1:**  
Slope gets larger: because the efficiency of small energy peaks were over estimated by counting in backgrounds in CW_140615.  
Constant gets smaller: Same reason.  
In CW_140615 I was counting hits within peak+-2keV region while didn't subtract the background.  
This time I narrowed the window to 0.025keV, which is still much larger than the peak width but exluding most background hits.

##Comparison with [Elog665](https://muon.npl.washington.edu/elog/mu2e/RunPSI2013/665)  
1.	**Option 1:**  
Slope:   -0.877724  VS  -0.8807,  0.3% larger, meaning that they have almost the same description of Ge detector performance.  
Constant: -2.02044 VS -2.784,  larger by 0.76, meaning that efficiency in MC is larger than callibration result by a factor of e<sup>0.76</sup>=2.14.  
2.	**Option 2:**  
Slope remains similar while constant gets smaller.
Only difference from **option 1** is geometrical acceptance.
3.	**Option 3:**  
Slope changed, while the error of fitting also increased. Probably because that the 10 mm thick flange distorted the curve.
Constant gets smaller.
