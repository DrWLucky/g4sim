Installation\r\nPrerequirements:  \r\n1.\tCMake installed  \r\n2.\tGeant4 installed  \r\n3.\tROOT installed  \r\n\r\n\t$ cmake .\r\n\t$ make\r\n\t\r\n###2. How to use\r\nPrerequirements:  \r\n\t\r\n1. \tGeant4 environment is set already. If not, then  \r\n`source /path/to/geant4/bin/geant4.sh`  \r\n`source /path/to/geant4/share/Geant4-*/geant4make/geant4make.sh`\r\n\t\r\n2.\tROOT environment is set already. If not, then  \r\n`source /path/to/root/bin/thisroot.sh`\r\n\r\n3.\tg4sim basic environment is set already. If not, then  \r\n`source /path/to/g4sim/env.sh`\r\n\r\nTo start:  \r\n\r\n\t$ source setup/test.sh       # Choose anyone you like, or write another by yourself\r\n\t$ ./g4sim [macros/run.mac]         # Choose any Geant4 macro file you want.\r\n\t                                   # without macro file it would enter interactive mode.\r\n\t                                   \r\nTo explain:  \r\n\r\n1.\tInteractive mode would apply **macros/vis.mac**, which would call `vis/open OGL`.\r\n\t\tIf you don't have `-DGEANT4_USE_RAYTRACER_X11=ON` when configure Geant4\r\n\t\tthen you may want to change these command.\r\n\r\n2.\tA file like in **setup** directory would set up a specific environment for a certain study purpose\r\n  \r\n###2. Examples\r\n1. Study the penetrating rate of anti-proton through Aluminium target\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
